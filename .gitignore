# AAMS Workspace — runtime artifacts (not for version control)
#
# WORKING/MEMORY/ltm-index.md is intentionally NOT ignored.
# It is the shared collaboration artifact — every agent and developer
# needs it to have context. Conflicts are minimal (append-only table).
#
# WORKING/WHITEPAPER/ and WORKING/WORKPAPER/ are also committed —
# they are the session and architecture history of the project.

# Logs: machine-generated runtime output, no collaboration value
WORKING/LOGS/

# Temporary workpaper drafts
WORKING/WORKPAPER/*.tmp

# Vector store backends (binary data, not diffable)
# Uncomment when using a vector store for LTM
# WORKING/AGENT-MEMORY/
# WORKING/MEMORY/*.db
# WORKING/MEMORY/chroma/
