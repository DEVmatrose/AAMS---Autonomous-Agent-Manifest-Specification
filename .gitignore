# AAMS Workspace — runtime artifacts (not for version control)
#
# WORKING/MEMORY/ltm-index.md is intentionally NOT ignored.
# It is the human-readable audit log — committed, always in Git, readable by humans.
#
# WORKING/AGENT-MEMORY/ is the queryable vector store (ChromaDB).
# It is ignored — binary data, not diffable, rebuilt from the audit log on first ingest.
#
# WORKING/WHITEPAPER/ and WORKING/WORKPAPER/ are committed —
# they are the session and architecture history of the project.

# Logs: machine-generated runtime output, no collaboration value
WORKING/LOGS/

# Temporary workpaper drafts
WORKING/WORKPAPER/*.tmp

# Vector store (binary data, not diffable — rebuilt from ltm-index.md on first ingest)
WORKING/AGENT-MEMORY/
WORKING/MEMORY/*.db
