## Purpose

This file serves as a table of contents for all whitepapers in the project. As projects grow, the number of whitepapers increases quickly — architecture decisions, feature specs, integration docs, design systems, API references. Without an index, agents and humans lose track.

**Recommendation:** Update this index whenever a whitepaper is created, renamed, or archived.
